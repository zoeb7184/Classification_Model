This project aims to develop an accurate machine learning model for predicting the likelihood of heart disease in individuals. By analyzing a wide range of medical data including demographic information, vital signs, cholesterol levels, and lifestyle factors, the model employs sophisticated classification algorithms to assess the risk of cardiovascular ailments. Through robust feature selection and rigorous model training, the system provides clinicians with valuable insights into patients' cardiac health, enabling early intervention and personalized treatment strategies. Ultimately, the project seeks to enhance preventive care efforts and mitigate the burden of heart disease on public health.
